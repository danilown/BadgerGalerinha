# [badger_2040](https://github.com/danilown/badger_2040)

The easiest way to get started is to go to [Pimoroni's official tutorial](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-badger-2040).

This repository contains mostly customized examples from [Pimoroni's Pico repository](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico), which can be found more specifically under `/micropython/examples/badger2040`.

## Getting Started

0. Install [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) to be able to easily interact with the board.

1. Put the Badger into bootloader mode by plugging it into the computer through the USB port while holding down its BOOT button. The Badger will mount as a drive named RPI-RP2 on your computer.

2. Copy the firmware to the Badger as described in the [Firmware section](#Firmware) and in [Pimoroni's official tutorial](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-badger-2040).

3. Using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/), copy **all** files and folders from the `/src` folder into the Badger. Select the items one by one while holding CTRL (or Command) and when you've selected all, just click with the right mouse button and select "Upload to /"

4. Have Fun!

## Problems with the Official release

Release v1.19.6 seams to have some bugs with the Badger.

### ImportError for `launchericons`

First, the `launchericons` module (more specifically, the `launchericons.py` file) is missing. According to [Issue 262](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/issues/262) it should be a built-in module, but if it is not.

Having a look at previous releases, this file is autogenerated using the `data_to_py.py` script. In this repository, it is found under `/utils/data_to_py.py`. In a few words, it will convert the image file into an importable Python module.

So, in this repository this was exactly done and already included.

> In Pimoroni's repository it can be found under `/examples/badger2040/image_converter/`.

## Firmware

To be able to program the Badger, you'll need the correct version of the micropython interpreter [here](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases).

> the release being used in this repository is [v1.19.6](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases/tag/v1.19.6).

Note that you have to choose the correct build for the Badge. The naming schema seems to not be fixed yet, but you should choose the one that looks something like `pimoroni-badger2040-v1.19.6-micropython.uf2`.


## Badger API

The API provided by Pimoroni is basically to control the e-ink display.

You will probably will come around statements like:

```python
badger = badger2040.Badger2040()
```

or 

```python
display = badger2040.Badger2040()
```

All functions are decently documented at Pimoroni's repository [here](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/main/micropython/modules/badger2040).
